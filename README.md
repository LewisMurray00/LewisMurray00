<h3 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Lewis </h3>
<br></br>

My name is Lewis Murray and i am a software developer
based in the UK 🇬🇧.

### My School of Code Journey 📁
Back in March 2021, i enrolled in the School Of Code
for their first part-time bootcamp. On this course we
were put through an intense bootcamp focused on learning
Front-End development

Upon this course we became familiar and learnt a whole
host of different skills and languages ranging from:

- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Tailwind
- UX & UI Design
- Node

this had all been done whilst following an agile
methodology. Having completed the course in September 2021,
i am hoping to expand what has been taught and increase
my knowledge whilst also learning new things
### My Stats 📊

Following this i have also used these languages and tools in a collabrative
project with the School of Code: 

- Typescript
- SCSS/SASS
- MongoDB
- Express
